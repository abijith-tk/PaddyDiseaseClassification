# VGG16 Model

The VGG16 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was proposed by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. It is widely used for image classification tasks.

## Architecture

The VGG16 model consists of 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from the input image, while the fully connected layers are responsible for making predictions based on those features.

The convolutional layers in VGG16 have a fixed filter size of 3x3 and a stride of 1, which means that the filters move across the input image one pixel at a time. The number of filters increases as we go deeper into the network, starting from 64 filters in the first layer and doubling in each subsequent layer.

After each convolutional layer, a max pooling layer with a filter size of 2x2 and a stride of 2 is applied. This helps reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and capture the most important features.

The fully connected layers in VGG16 have 4096 units each, followed by a final output layer with the number of units equal to the number of classes in the classification task.

## Pretrained Weights

VGG16 is often used with pretrained weights, which are learned on a large dataset such as ImageNet. These pretrained weights can be used as a starting point for transfer learning, where the model is fine-tuned on a smaller dataset specific to the task at hand.

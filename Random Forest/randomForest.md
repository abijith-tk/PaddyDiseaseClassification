# Random Forest

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

## How does it work?

1. **Random Sampling**: Random Forest randomly selects a subset of the training data with replacement (known as bootstrapping) to create multiple subsets called "bootstrap samples".

2. **Random Feature Selection**: For each bootstrap sample, Random Forest randomly selects a subset of features to build a decision tree. This helps to introduce randomness and reduce overfitting.

3. **Building Decision Trees**: Random Forest builds multiple decision trees using the selected features and the bootstrap samples. Each decision tree is trained independently.

4. **Voting or Averaging**: For classification tasks, Random Forest combines the predictions of all decision trees using majority voting. For regression tasks, it averages the predictions of all decision trees.

## Advantages of Random Forest

- Random Forest is robust to outliers and noisy data.
- It can handle a large number of input features without feature selection.
- Random Forest provides estimates of feature importance, which can be useful for feature selection.
- It is less prone to overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

## Limitations of Random Forest

- Random Forest can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets and a large number of trees.
- It may not perform well on imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the others.
- Random Forest may not provide good interpretability compared to a single decision tree.

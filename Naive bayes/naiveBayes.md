# Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class.

## How it works

1. **Training phase**: During the training phase, the algorithm calculates the prior probabilities of each class and the likelihood of each feature given the class.

2. **Prediction phase**: In the prediction phase, the algorithm uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of each class given the features. The class with the highest posterior probability is then assigned as the predicted class.

## Assumptions

The Naive Bayes classifier makes the following assumptions:

- **Feature independence**: It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class. This is a strong assumption and may not hold true in all cases.

- **Equal importance**: It treats all features as equally important. This may not be true in some scenarios where certain features have more predictive power than others.

## Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Naive Bayes is a simple algorithm that is easy to understand and implement.

- **Efficiency**: It is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with high dimensionality.

- **Good performance**: Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice, especially in text classification tasks.

## Limitations

- **Feature independence assumption**: The assumption of feature independence may not hold true in real-world scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance.

- **Sensitive to input data**: Naive Bayes can be sensitive to the quality and distribution of the input data. It may not perform well if the data violates the assumptions of the algorithm.

- **Zero probability problem**: If a feature has not been observed in the training data with a particular class, the Naive Bayes classifier assigns a zero probability to that feature, which can lead to incorrect predictions.

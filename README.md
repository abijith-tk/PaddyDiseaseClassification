# Paddy Disease Classification

#### Image Classification project to compare the accuracy of different machine learning models

#### In this project we compare different types of machine learning models such as Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifiers.

##### We compare 5 types of paddy diseases

- Blast
  
- Dead Heart
  
- Hispa
  
- Normal
  
- Tungro

##### In conclusion we identified that Neural Network model VGG16 is more accurate than other models
